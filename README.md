# DIP-Task-5
Task 05
Write a Python program using PIL, NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib to perform spatial domain filtering on a grayscale image. The program should first load and display the original image. Then, apply different noise reduction and smoothing filters including Mean Filter, Median Filter, Mode Filter, and Gaussian Filter. Display the filtered images individually as well as in a combined comparison layout. Finally, analyze and explain the effect of each filter on the original image in terms of noise removal, edge preservation, blurring, and suitable use cases.
